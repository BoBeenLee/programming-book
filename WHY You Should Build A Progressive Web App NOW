Simply making sense != Simple to design and build

When it comes to visual design and interaction patterns,
start by forgetting everything you know about conventional web design,
and instead imagine you're actually designing a native app.

It's important to pay attention to detail here since
native apps have given users expectations around 
touch interactions and information hierachy which are
important to match to avoid creating a jarring experience.

Not every customer or potential customer will add 
your Progressive Web App to their home screen.
...but every visitor will install your PWA!

Four questions for PWAs

2. What impact does going chromeless have on UX?
3. To App Shell or not to App Shell?
4. What part of your site should be made into a PWA?
