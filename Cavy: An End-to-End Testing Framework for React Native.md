## What is Cavy?
Cavy = an end-to-end testing framework
Open source testing framework for RN android, ios

## Why do you need Cavy?
Aren't there enough testing frameworks out there already?

Unit testing with Jest
- Great for unit testing individual components and stores
- Snapshot testing
- Shallow render testing with Enzyme

End-to-end testing with...
- Appium?
- Calabash and Cucumber?
- Detox?

## How did we build it?

Test hooks
  - To access the components being tested

## What does it look like in practice?

## Where is it going next?
