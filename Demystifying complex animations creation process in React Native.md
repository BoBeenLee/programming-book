[Demystifying complex animations creation process in React Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6VbcTe0SjE&list=WL&index=3&t=0s)

### Why do we need to Animate?
- Make your app stand out
- Provide visual hints
- Define "story" of your app
- Reduce cognitive load
- Reduce cognitive friction

### Cognitive load
- The total amount of mental effort that is required to complete a task involving processing of information.

### Cognitive friction
- Cognitive friction occurs when a user is confronted with an interface that appears to be intuitive but delivers unexpected results

### UI should be preditable

### UI should react fluidly on user actions

### Magic is both in the details and in the performance.

### React Native college of wizardry
- "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"

### Young Merlin knows about
- Animated
- Lottie
- Reanimated

### He gets a Design from proud artist

### Divide and conquer
- Microinterations
- Action Driven animations
- Screen transitions
- Gesture animations / onScroll behaviors

### Different style types
- scale changes
- opacity changes
- translate X and Y

### Gestures
- Sometimes onScroll behaviors are confused for gestures

### TakeAways
- Animatiaons are not that scary
- Beware of State Driven Animations
- Tell a story in your app
- Don't overcomplicate things
- Reduce cognitive load and friction
- Stick to working practices and experiences
