[Moving Existing API From REST To GraphQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=broQmxQAMjM)

RESTful APIs are optimized for servers, not clients

what if we wanted to pu clients first?
backends for frontends
what about public api?

a data query language - think SQL

GraphQL is a query language Specification
features of the query language
GraphQL is typed

GraphQL is introspectable - GraphiQL
documentation and client generation, are free

Multiple resources in one round trip

GraphQL schemas have resolvers

data can be resolved from anywhere
Which makes GraphQL servers facade

a facade in front of databases, cache, services
you use your existing application code

Schema driven development
new features were developed for the UI
then staff shipped
then released.
REST API work started after the release.
but today...
all new features are built with GraphQL from start

this. allows us to build a true public API or platform

what if we wanted to pu clients first?
