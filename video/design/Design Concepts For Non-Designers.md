- Design:
  - making an interface that works well.

- Fastest way for better looking design:
  - cut down on clutter.

- Line things up 
  - pixel differences are definitely unconsciously noticed.

- Color principles
  - keep your colors complimentary.
  - use mostly neutrals + one brighter color for importatnt bits.

- Fonts
  - Keep the number of fonts low 
  - two different fonts is usually a good rule of thumb.
    - Use fancy/display fonts sparingly - very cluttery.
    - Vary weights(bold), style(italics), and transforms(uppercase, etc.) to differentiate bits.
    - I love google fonts.

- White space
  - The ultimate clutter reducer.
