## Correct Tools For the JOB

### CSS-in-JS/Styles
+ Small sequences and simple interations
+ Once you get more than 3... switch to:

### GSAP (GreenSock)
+ Great for sequencing and complex movement
+ Cross-browser consistency

### React-Motion
Great for single movements that you'd like to look realistic
<br/>

+ React-Tween similar to React-Motion: time instead of spring
+ React-Move similar to React-Motion: small, flexible
+ Snap.svg is more like jQuery for SVG
+ Web Animation API looks great, still waiting on support
+ Velocity-React is similar to GSAP with less bells and whistles
+ Mo.js spins up shapes declaratively and is still in beta
